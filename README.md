# DAO-BTC 
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations with Bitcoin-Native Treasury Management

üöÄ Overview

DAO-BTC is a governance framework built on Stacks that enables DAOs to manage their treasuries directly in Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs most secure asset.
Unlike DAOs that rely on speculative governance tokens, DAO-BTC anchors community funds in Bitcoin while leveraging Clarity smart contracts for decision-making, voting, and accountability.

This system makes DAO treasuries trustless, transparent, and future-proof ‚Äî empowering communities, cooperatives, and organizations worldwide to govern and grow their Bitcoin holdings together.

üîß Key Features
1. Bitcoin-Native Vaults

DAO treasuries are stored in multisig BTC wallets, secured by community-chosen signers and flexible rules.

2. Policy-Driven Proposals

Members propose treasury actions like payments, grants, or investments. Votes determine what happens, ensuring collective decision-making.

3. Off-Chain Signer Orchestration

Smart contracts can‚Äôt directly move BTC, so a signer service watches proposals on Stacks and co-signs Bitcoin transactions only after governance approval.

4. Dynamic Governance Models

Supports multiple governance styles:

Token-based voting

Reputation/NFT-based governance

Hybrid systems for unique community needs

5. Risk & Safeguards

Time-locks on large withdrawals

Emergency freeze switches for suspicious activity

Diversification options for stable assets or yield strategies

6. Inclusive Participation

Mobile-first access with SMS or USSD voting, so communities in low-connectivity areas can participate in governance.

7. Plug-and-Play Extensions

Activate modules for:

Charity transparency (track donations)

Grants management (fund builder rounds)

City/community projects (govern local development funds)

8. Cross-DAO Collaboration

Federated DAOs can link treasuries for joint initiatives, creating a powerful network of interdependent Bitcoin-governed communities.
