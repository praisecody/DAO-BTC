# DAO-BTC

üåç Overview

DAO-BTC is a framework for creating Bitcoin-native DAOs on Stacks. It empowers communities, cooperatives, protocols, and organizations to pool resources, govern decisions, and securely manage a treasury held in native Bitcoin.

Instead of locking treasuries in volatile ERC-20 tokens, DAO-BTC anchors governance to the hardest asset in the world ‚Äî Bitcoin ‚Äî while still leveraging the programmability of Clarity on Stacks.

üîß Key Functional Features (Expanded)
1. Proposal & Voting System

Members can create proposals such as:

‚ÄúSend 0.5 BTC from treasury to wallet X to fund developer grants.‚Äù

‚ÄúSwap 1 BTC for STX to provide liquidity.‚Äù

Voting weights can be tied to:

Governance tokens

Soulbound NFTs (identity governance)

Reputation scores (active contributor system)

Flexible voting methods: simple majority, quadratic voting, or delegated voting.

2. Bitcoin Multisig Treasury

Treasury is secured via a 3-of-5 (or configurable) multisig wallet on Bitcoin.

Signers are DAO-approved, rotated periodically via governance.

DAO can configure signers to be:

Trusted community members

Professional signers (like Anchorage, Casa, or BitGo)

Hybrid: 2 community + 3 professional signers for resilience.

3. Execution Flow (On-Chain + Off-Chain)

Proposal created and voted on in Clarity contract.

If approved, Clarity emits an event log containing transaction details.

Off-chain signer services detect the event, co-sign the Bitcoin transaction.

Once threshold is met, the BTC is released.

Ensures Stack-based governance triggers BTC transactions in a trust-minimized flow.

4. Treasury Risk Management

Diversification options: Swap partial BTC holdings into STX, USDC, or sBTC for liquidity.

Emergency pause switch: DAO can freeze treasury actions in case of attack or suspected collusion.

Time-locks: Critical treasury actions require a cooling-off period before execution.

5. DAO Membership & Identity

NFT-based membership badges tied to wallet addresses.

Voting power adjusts based on contribution or membership tier.

Identity options: anonymous (ZK proofs) or verified (KYC-linked for real-world DAOs).

6. Cross-Border Governance Tools

Multilingual governance dashboards.

Support for mobile voting via SMS/USSD for low-connectivity communities.

Reputation-linked governance score that persists across DAOs.

7. Extensions & Add-ons

Grants DAO: Run community development funds.

Charity DAO: Pool BTC to donate directly to verified NGOs.

City DAO: Local communities managing shared Bitcoin treasuries for infrastructure.

Yield DAO: Convert part of BTC into productive yield via Bitcoin L2 solutions.

üöÄ Why It‚Äôs Great for Stacks

Bitcoin-first: Unlike Ethereum DAOs, DAO-BTC secures treasuries in BTC.

Clarity safety: Governance logic runs on Clarity, a decidable smart contract language with predictable outcomes.

Bridges TradFi + DeFi: Enables cooperatives, city governments, charities, and startups to manage treasuries transparently with the assurance of Bitcoin‚Äôs immutability.

üìú Example Use Cases

Open Source Communities pooling BTC donations and voting on how to spend funds.

Cooperatives / Unions managing shared savings and investments.

NGOs & Charities ensuring transparent fund allocation.

City DAOs managing Bitcoin-based community treasuries for local development.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Clarity Smart Contracts (for proposals, voting, and governance rules).

Stacks Blockchain (anchors governance to Bitcoin).

Bitcoin Multisig Wallets (native BTC custody).

Off-chain Signer Services (watchers that co-sign Bitcoin transactions when proposals pass).

üèóÔ∏è Roadmap

MVP

Deploy governance contract on Stacks.

Enable proposal creation, voting, and event emission.

Integrate with Bitcoin multisig signer service.

Future Features

ZK-based anonymous voting.

DAO insurance funds.

Multi-DAO collaborations (federated treasuries).

On-chain BTC swaps (sBTC integration).
